# Heatmaps 
## Heatmaps - presentation of data on the side ie AMR / other stuff

### Tutorial section 

# ggtree extra library

## Distances heatmaps
### Data for this tutorial section 
> could we also use the apec 2021 ? 

### Tutorial section 

Eve tree/rotated/tree and phylogeny

> can also use part of that to show how to create weird composite color scales
> getting the distances in a proper format for display - Apec2021 (Is ready there)
might just need to improve the documentation of the function

# Manipulating tree data formats
> advantages
- avoid the NA when plotting
- merging directly metadata and tree (sure its not a problem when plotting)


## Facets -> Phylogeography
### Data for this tutorial section 
> here maybe should use a dummy data - > cannot really use the yersinia ? or ask

### Tutorial section 

Maps and Trees on facets in time --- 

- getting a map
- getting the tree 
- time splitting / faceting

> Need to make the functions more general - see Yersinia ! and put that in ggtreevextra


# Creating zooms on specific clades 
## ggtree clade specific - the simple solution

> limirations 

## subsetting the tree - plotting subsets as independent tree
> see Broiler repo -> for being able to subset clades and plot individually 
> or find other solutions ! 


## Other things ?
- Finding a solution to get segments for phylogeography ...
- composite plots (tree, heatmap and other plots ...)
