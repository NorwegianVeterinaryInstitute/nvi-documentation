# ggtree extra library

Håkon - geom_fruit is central to introduce in a tutorial

# Proper tree rerooting
### Data for this tutorial section 
> could we use apec2021 -> showing also the problem of wrong middle rerooting ? was good one
### Tutorial section 

- Step by step
- The wrapper function in package (ggtreevextra) - to do

# Heatmaps 
## Heatmaps - presentation of data on the side ie AMR / other stuff
### Data for this tutorial section 
### Tutorial section 



Håkon 

## Distances heatmaps
### Data for this tutorial section 
> could we also use the apec 2021 ? 

### Tutorial section 

Eve tree/rotated/tree and phylogeny

> can also use part of that to show how to create weird composite color scales
> getting the distances in a proper format for display - Apec2021 (Is ready there)
might just need to improve the documentation of the function


## Facets -> Phylogeography
### Data for this tutorial section 
> here maybe should use a dummy data - > cannot really use the yersinia ? or ask

### Tutorial section 

Maps and Trees on facets in time --- 

- getting a map
- getting the tree 
- time splitting / faceting

> Need to make the functions more general - see Yersinia ! and put that in ggtreevextra


## Other things ?
