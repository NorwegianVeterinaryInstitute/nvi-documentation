# Overview: 
VIGAS/P stands for Veteriary Institute Genome Analysis System/Platform. VIGASP uses IRIDA for data management, data access control, analysis and storing the results. IRIDA uses Galaxy to execute the pipelines. 

# Accessing VIGAS and logging in
VIGAS is accessible only from official VI Laptops or through VI-VPN. 
Those who want to get user names has to send email to Jeevan (jeevan.karloss.antony-samy@vetinst.no) with following details: 
1. Explanation: Why do you need access to VIGAS
2. Preferred user name and mobile number
3. List of species data do you want to have access for. We wil talk to the managers of those projects in VIGAS and give you access to those data/metadata/results.

# Data management and access control 
In IRIDA, data (Fastq files, meta data and results) are organized as projects (species bucket). No data can stand alone. F. ex. All salmonella data are part of "Salmonella spp" project and all Listeria data are part of "Listeria spp" project. Users can create projects where they can share the data from main project to do furether project specific analysis. Only the members of the project can access, share and see data and the results.  

# Pipeline overview 
AS of January 2024, VIGAS has 12 pipelines. 8 of them are developed in house at NVI. Project managers can set up automated pipelines with customized parameters for each project.    

# Data transfer and Automated Pipeline
Sequenced data from NVI sequencing lab are semi-automatically(so far) transferred to VIGAS using SAGA/NIRD.
